You want to use the cron service for this. A quick guide:

    Log in to the server
    Switch to the user as which you want to run the program/script as
    Run the command crontab -e
    You now get an editor. At the end of the line, add:

0 3 * * * /path/to/program_or_script.sh >/dev/null 2>&1

    Save the file

This will run the command every day at 03:00. You can adjust the times accordingly. The >/dev/null 2>&1 will discard any output from the command.

You could replace the /path/to/program_or_script.sh by a one-liner, or you could put your 'code' in a small shell script (start the file with #!/bin/bash and add the 'code' on a new line).

Keep in mind that most cron environments don't have a full shell environment, so you would have to set environment variables or even PATH settings manually (PATH=/usr/bin:/bin etc.)
