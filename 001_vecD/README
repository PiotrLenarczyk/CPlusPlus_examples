Program presents idea of dimensional vector containing of nested vectors of floats. First dimension vector consist of floats in continous memory region, as a result of nesting second dimension level contains pointers to first dimension vectors. It is trivially aplicable for example matrix representation. It is slightly slower than float arrays, but:
1) it is a containers composite
2) few useful vector functions ( size(), resize(), erase(), etc. )
3) much more intuitive than standard vector < float >, with almost the same efficiency
4) has built-in [][] operator support
5) use y, than x for nested loops ( x's are sequentional in memory - as a result these are "CPU cachable" ) 
6) quite portable
